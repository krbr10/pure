	<h3>Reviews:</h3>
	<p><i><b>If you interested how chocolate is made and want to try it yourself,
		  this is a great oportunity. Also you can buy chocolate for special prices in the end.</b></i></p>  
	<p><i><b>This museum is in the middle of nowhere and I didn't expect it to be particulalrly good, but actually it was.
		There's interesting information on cocoa bean cultivation, chocolate making, the history of chocolate, etc. Almost all
		the displays had English translations as well as Russian and Latvian and the standard of English was near perfect.
		I learnt a lot. Be sure to have a coffee or snack in the cafe next door with its view of the valley.</b></i></p>
	<p><i><b>Really Nice place and really good Chocolate!!! :) I had a good time and it was fun to make our own chocolate :)</b></i></p>
